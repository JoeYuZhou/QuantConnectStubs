# QuantConnectStubs

The stubs are generated using a modified https://github.com/gtalarico/ironpython-stubs. 

The stubs can be used in VS Code to setup intellisense (which was my intial target IDE). However as the engine which generated the stubs are from PyCharm. It has the better user expereince I found.
